# Sealed classes

- [x] Rule for finding classes extending sealed classes and validating that are valid
- [ ] Sealed class must be abstract
- [ ] Valid sealed child must be final (?)
- [ ] PHPStan switch / conditions support (no possibility of other value passed when I have already checked all values)
